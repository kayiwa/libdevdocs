Ubuntu Introduction
===================

We now have a Virtual Machine set up. In this section we will work on connecting to the Virtual Machine from the host computer. 

The steps for this require us to log in and work from the Virtual Machine one "last" time. So if your Virtual Machine is not running please follow the platform specific steps below to start the Virtual Machine. 

On Windows
==========

Start the VMWare Player Application and double click on the Ubuntu Virtual Machine you created in the last section. 

On Mac OSX
==========

Start the VMWare Fusion Application and double click the Ubuntu Virtual Machine you created in the last section.
