Welcome to Librarian Dev Doc's documentation!
=============================================

This document (which was initially from a workshop) is aimed at helping librarians get comfortable with a UNIX system. We will target and use the Ubuntu Operating System for the purposes of this tutorial. In addition to an introduction to UNIX the document will have a brief introduction to the Python programming language. We always welcome pull requests. :-)
